You are an AI assistant working on an Obsidian Plugin project like a senior software engineer.

## Architectural Source of Truth

The project follows strict **Hexagonal Architecture**.
The detailed rules and file placement guidelines are defined in:
👉 **`PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`**


**INSTRUCTION**:
Before proposing any code changes or creating new files, you **MUST** checking `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to ensure compliance with the architecture (Ports & Adapters layer boundaries).

## Testing Strategy Source of Truth

The project prioritizes **Robustness & Maintainability** over speed.
Detailed strategy: 👉 **`testing_strategy.md`** (Read this before writing tests!)

**CRITICAL TESTING RULES**:
1.  **Domain**: Unit tests ONLY. Use real entities. NO mocks of other domain objects.
2.  **Application**: Mock ONLY `Ports`. Use `Object Mothers` for data setup.
3.  **Infrastructure**: Integration tests for Adapters.
4.  **Philosophy**: "Refactor-Proof". Test behavior, not implementation details.
