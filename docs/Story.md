# The Elocuency Story

In 2020, more or less, I wanted to create a chatbot to help people learn English. The idea was to have a bot that quizzes you on vocabulary and grammar, and then scores your results. 😂😂😂 Back in 2020, a chatbot was quite a crazy idea 🤖. At the time, it was just a React app with a Node.js backend using Loopback (an IBM framework) and a MongoDB database. It was a lot of fun, yet very challenging to build. However, it wasn't really a chatbot; it was more of a quiz bot. But I learned a lot about MongoDB, Node.js, and React in the process.

In 2023, I changed the technology stack to transform it into a real chatbot, using NextJS, NestJS, PostgreSQL, and an Nx monorepo. This was my professional stack, and it was very useful for improving my skills. It was a lot of work, and I continued learning many new things along the way.

Later, I shifted to an AWS architecture, using Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, RDS, and S3, with Terraform for deployment. This was another major shift, and once again, I learned a great deal.

And now, at the beginning of 2026, I look at the AI landscape and I see the light. Now I can finally build a real bot to learn English, or to talk about things I'm passionate about. While doing a Master's in "Developing with AI" at "Big School," I can see a world of new possibilities. This was the moment to start Elocuency v3, based on modern AI tools.

For Elocuency v3, I started by creating Obsidian plugins with an AI assistant to build my personal knowledge base within an Obsidian vault. With this AI assistant, I realized it was the perfect time to create my own personal agent—one that uses my knowledge base to answer questions and help me with my daily tasks.

The imagination is the limit, and I have plenty of it! 😂😂😂

Enjoy and share! 😜
