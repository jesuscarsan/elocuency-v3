# Elocuency Framework v3 - Introduction

Elocuency is a framework for developing personal learning and productivity applications with the ambition of becoming a personal operating system: Life OS.

To structure it organically, each functionality for groups of use cases are packaged into apps within their corresponding folder. The framework provides tools and libraries for the coordinated development of these applications.

To make it easy to start using, many initial functionalities are packaged as Obsidian plugins. However, the framework does not depend on Obsidian. Obsidian is the first approach for users. 

Although the idea has been maturing for many years, testing different approaches and technologies, now with AI, it is truly possible to carry it out.

The rest of the information can be found in the docs folder. Each app project has its own docs folder.
